# Moonchain LPWAN Protocol

Moonchain implements its own Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) Protocol, providing businesses with a decentralized solution for managing IoT devices and Data. Here's how it works:

## Overview

Businesses can establish and operate their own LPWAN server on Moonchain without the need for a central administrator. This self-operated system ensures greater control and security over IoT data management processes.

### Key Features

    - **Decentralized Operation**:
        - Businesses manage their own LPWAN server independently, eliminating the need for a central administrator.
    - **Token Locking Requirement**:
        - To participate in the LPWAN Protocol, entities must lock six million $MXC tokens. This locking mechanism is akin to staking in popular blockchain marketplaces like OpenSea, ensuring commitment and trust within the network.
    - **Customizable Miner Participation**:
        - Any brand of miner wishing to participate must run a customized version of the LPWAN Protocol. This promotes network diversity and enhances operational flexibility.
    - **Service Fees**:
        - Sensors or IoT devices utilizing the LPWAN Protocol are required to pay service fees to miners for data transmissions and validations services.
    - **Security and Control**:
        - By adopting this decentralized architecture, businesses retain control over their IoT data while adhering to high security and operational standards.
    - **Cost-Effective Solution**:
        - The LPWAN Protocol on Moonchain offers a cost-effective alternative for businesses looking to streamline IoT data management, reducing reliance on traditional centralized solutions.

Below is a illustrated overview of how the LPWAN infrastructure on Moonchain looks like.
