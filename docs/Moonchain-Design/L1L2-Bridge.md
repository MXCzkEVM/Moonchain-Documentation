# Bridging between L1/L2

Bridges are essential for facilitating cross-chain transactions and interactions among users and applications. Moonchain's zkEVM features a robust and secure bridging solution to enhance interoperability and streamling user experiences. Notoriously, bridging has been a dangerous operation. How do you make sure that this bridge is secure?

Let's dive into the explanation of bridging on Moonchain. We will answer the following questions along the way:
    - What is the difference between the Moonchain bridge and Taiko Bridge?
    - What is the Moonchain bridge dApp?
    - What if i want to use ETH or other currencies on Moonchain zkEVM?

Moonchain's bridging design significantly enhances the interconnectivity of EVM chains, offering a robust framework for creating diverse applications on zkEVM. This design also facilitates the integration of $MXC coins across all EVM chains, positioning Moonchain to drive the growth of the decentralized finance (DeFi) space with innovative applications on its cutting-edge platform.

## Moonchain Bridge vs. Taiko Bridge
### Moonchain Bridge
The bridge is designed specifically for Moonchain's zkEVM ecosystem, focusing on seamless integration of IoT sensors, DePIN, NFTs, RWAs and other applications. It allows the transfer of $MXC tokens and other ERC-20 tokens between Arbitrum and Moonchahin zkEVM, leveraging the unique capabilities of zkEVM, such as its signal service. This enables a smooth and secure bridging experience without the need for ETH as the default gas fee.

### Taiko Bridge
The Taiko bridge, on the other hand, focuses on bridging ETH to various EVM chains. It uses ETH as the default gas fee, enhancing transaction throughput and interoperability across different Ethereum-based networks. Taiko's cross-chain messaging framework ensures secure and efficient transactions, making it a valuable took for users who prefer using ETH.

## Moonchain's Bridging dApp
The Moonchain Bridge dApp is a comprehensive solution designed for transferring $MXC and ERC-20 tokens between Arbitrum and Moonchain zkEVM. This decentralized application integrates intelligent contracts with a frontend web interface, utilizing advanced technology to ensure seamless and secure token transfers. By showcasing the platform's capabilities, the Moonchain Bridge dApp provides users with an intuitive tool for bridging assets across blockchain networks.
If you're curious about the bridge, you can explore its features and functionalities by [trying it out yourself](https://erc20.moonchain.com/). You can also follow our step-by-step tutorial [here](/docs/Mainnet-Tutorials/Using-The-L3-Bridge).

## Bridging ETH to Moonchain zkEVM
Despite ETH not being the default gas fee on Moonchain zkEVM, users can bridge and utilize ETH on the platform through Wrapped ETH [(WETH)](https://arbiscan.io/token/0x82af49447d8a07e3bd95bd0d56f35241523fbab1) from the Arbitrum chain. WETH is a tokenized representation of ETH that facilitates easy transfer and compatibility across Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-based chains.

By leveraging the Moonchain Bridge dApp, a decentralized application designed for seamless asset transfers between Arbitrum and Moonchain zkEVM, users can initiate the transfer of WETH tokens. This process ensures secure and efficient cross-chain transactions, maintaining asset integrity and security throughout.

Furthermore, this bridging capability extends to all other native chain tokens wrapped within EVM-compatible chains. This feature enhances the interoperability of Moonchain zkEVM, providing users with expanded options for managing and utilizing digital assets within decentralized applications and transactions.
