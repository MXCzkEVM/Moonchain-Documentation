# MCH tokenomics


## Introduction 

The tokenomics of $MCH represent a paradigm shift in network bootstrapping and value accrual. By pioneering the Initial Hardware Offering (IHO) model, we have created a system where the token is not merely a transactional asset but the fundamental key to network participation and ownership. This document outlines how the $MCH token's utility, distribution, and demand drivers are interconnected to fuel the mass global expansion of Moonchain's distributed AI compute layer, ensuring long-term alignment between the protocol, its builders, and its users.

### Core Token Utilities

The $MCH token is essential for interacting with every layer of the Moonchain ecosystem. Its primary utilities are:

*   **Staking for Hardware (IHO Participation):** This is the cornerstone utility. Users must acquire and stake $MCH tokens to participate in Initial Hardware Offerings. This is the **only** way to receive the functional hardware that acts as a node in the network, transforming the token into a key that unlocks access to productive, real-world assets.

*   **Access & Priority to AI Services:** As the network's distributed compute layer matures, $MCH will function as the primary access token. Holding or spending $MCH will grant developers and enterprises access to the network's AI services, including benefits like prioritized data processing and increased bandwidth.

*   **Network Incentives & Data Mining:** Hardware operators who deploy their devices and contribute valuable data to the network are rewarded with $MCH tokens. This incentive mechanism, funded by the largest token allocation, ensures the continuous health, growth, and data generation of the network.

### Demand Drivers & Value Accrual

The tokenomics are designed with powerful, built-in mechanisms to drive demand and accrue value to the $MCH token.

1.  **The IHO Demand Flywheel:** The IHO model creates a powerful and repeatable cycle of demand.
    *   **Hardware Announcement:** A new IHO creates immediate market interest.
    *   **Buy Pressure:** Users must purchase $MCH on the open market to participate.
    *   **Supply Sink:** The staking process locks up vast amounts of $MCH, removing them from circulating supply and increasing scarcity (proven by a TVL of 63.8M+ tokens in the first 2 weeks).
    *   **Network Growth:** Successful IHOs expand the hardware network, increasing its intrinsic value and setting the stage for the next cycle.

2.  **Productive Asset Staking:** Unlike staking for simple APY, the IHO model locks tokens in exchange for a productive asset. This creates a much stickier and more stable Total Value Locked (TVL), as participants are invested for the long term to operate their hardware and earn rewards.

3.  **Utility-Driven Service Fees:** The long-term demand for $MCH will be driven by fees for its core product: AI compute services. As adoption grows, the need to acquire $MCH to pay for these services will create a sustainable, non-speculative source of buy pressure.

### Token Distribution

The $MCH token supply is allocated to foster long-term, sustainable growth, with a primary focus on community-driven network expansion.

| Category                  | Allocation | Purpose                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------- | :--------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **AI + IHO Data Mining**  |   **48%**  | The largest allocation, reserved as rewards for hardware operators (node runners) who provide data and compute resources. This is the fuel for network participation. |
| **Team**                  |   **20%**  | For core contributors, founders, and future hires, subject to long-term vesting to ensure alignment with the project's success.                                       |
| **Ecosystem Fund**        |   **20%**  | To fund community grants, developer bounties, strategic partnerships, and marketing efforts to bootstrap network adoption and innovation.                          |
| **Liquidity / MM**        |   **10%**  | To ensure a healthy and stable trading environment on exchanges, providing deep liquidity for the $MCH token from day one.                                            |
| **Binance Holder Drop**   |    **2%**  | A strategic allocation designed to directly reward Binance users, drive immediate community engagement, and ensure a highly successful launch on the platform.         |
| **Total Supply**          |  **100%**  |                                                                                                                                                                    |

### Vesting & Release Schedule

Our release schedule is designed for market stability and long-term alignment, ensuring that the vast majority of the token supply is locked or reserved for value-generative activities.

*   **Locked at Launch (68% of Total Supply):**
    *   **Team (20%):** Fully locked at launch and subject to a standard multi-year vesting schedule post-TGE.
    *   **AI + IHO Data Mining (48%):** Fully locked at launch. These tokens are not for sale and will be released programmatically over many years as mining rewards to network participants.

*   **Initial Circulating Supply (32% of Total Supply):**
    *   Comprised of the **Liquidity (10%)**, **Ecosystem Fund (20%)**, and **Binance Holder Drop (2%)** allocations. This controlled initial supply is dedicated entirely to bootstrapping a healthy market and fostering ecosystem growth.

### Key Metrics

*   **Launch Market Cap:** $40M (Comprising Liquidity + Holder Drop + Eco-System Fund)
*   **Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV):** $125M
