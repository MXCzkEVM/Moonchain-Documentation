# Build a DApp: MangaDrop on Moonchain

This guide will help you build the MangaDrop dapp on Moonchain (Geneva testnet)! The airdrop dapp highlights an important feature of Moonchain: deploying ERC20 tokens and conducting airdrops seamlessly. You can deploy tokens, manage them, and execute airdrops all through our user-friendly interface. Read more about the functionalities and architecture in our detailed documentation [here](https://github.com/MXCzkEVM/token-airdrop-x2e/tree/geneva).


## Steps
**1. Try Token Airdrop Templates**: Utilize the [token airdrop templates](https://github.com/MXCzkEVM/token-airdrop-x2e/tree/geneva) to create an airdrop in one click.

**2. Status Page Integration**: Integrate the status widget to monitor the zkEVM operational status in case of any changes.
```html
<script src="https://mxc.instatus.com/13076080/widget/script.js"></script>
```
This will show a pup-up widget if the zkEVM has a new incident.

By following these steps, you can easily build and manage the MangaDrop dapp on the Moonchain Geneva Testnet, taking advantage of its seamless ERC20 token deployment and airdrop functionalities.
