# A Brief Introduction

Welcome to the official developer documentation of Moonchain. Dive into the world of decentralized solutions with our groundbreaking Type 1 zk-EVM and zk-Rollups, built on top of Arbitrum and harnessing the power of Taiko ZK.

:::tip WIP
This documentation is still a work in progress. Some topics have been discussed in greater depth, while others require additional clarification. Sections of this documentation might be reorganized later to achieve a better flow.

If you are interested in learning about the basics of zero-knowledge proofs, EVM, and other fundamental concepts behind our Layer 3 zkEVM, check out Moonchain on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Moonchain_com).

## üìñIntroducing Moonchain zkEVM

Welcome to the cutting-edge world of Moonchain, engineered to serve as the Ethereum for the Internet of Things (IoT), Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN), and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Unlike other blockchains, Moonchain is uniquely designed to make DePIN, AI and IoT scalable. Our team of seasoned developers and blockchain experts is at the forefront of the Web3 revolution, pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

### üî•Key Features

- **IoT/DePIN Scaling**: Enhancing the scalability of IoT and DePIN applications using the Moonchain ($MXC) token as underlying foundation of the infrastructure.
- **Wide Range of Applications**: Empowering developers to design, backtest, and deploy any application on the Moonchain Layer 3 blockchain.
- **Advanced Token Capabilities**: Facilitating Sensor Token Offerings (STOs) and NFT issuances for real-world assets, leveraging innovative protocols like [MEP-600](/docs/Moonchain-Design/MEPs-Moonchain)

## üåéNative dApp Solutions

At Moonchain, we've developed a suite of native decentralized applications (dApps) to enhance and support your projects. When you deploy your application on Moonchain, you can directly use our in-house dApps to extend utility, functionality and streamline integration. These include:

- **L1-L3 Bridge**: Seamlessly connect to different blockchain layers, facilitating smooth and efficient asset transfers.
- **NFT Marketplace**: Create, buy, sell and trde NFTs with ease on our robust marketplace platform.
- **Swapping dApp**: Exchange token pairs effortlessly using our intuitive swapping application.
- **Moonchain Name Service (MNS)**: Create custom, easy-to-remember names to simplify transactions across blockchains, unify your identity in the Web3 ecosystem, and manage your decentralized websites.
- **XSD (Lending and Borrowing Protocol)**: Add collateral to borrow funds, maximizing the utility of your tokens through our comprehensive protocol.

These are just a few examples of our extensive collection of dApps designed to enhance your experience on Moonchain. Discover more [here](https://www.moonchain.com), and leverage our innovative solutions to propel your decentralized applications forward.

## üåä Use the Geneva testnet

Before deploying to the Moonchain mainnet, it's essential to backtest your applications on the Geneva testnet. Find all the instructions in our guides, including:

- **Block explorer**: Explore transactions and blocks on the Geneva testnet with ease.
- **Wannsee bridge/faucet**: Access resources to bridge tokens or obtain testnet tokens for development purposes.
- **NFT Marketplace**: Experiment with creating and interacting with NFTs.
- **Geneva Swap**: Test token swaps and liquidity provisions in a controlled environment.
- **Moonchain Name Service (MNS)**: Create custom, easy-to-remember names to simplify transactions across blockchains, unify your identity in the Web3 ecosystem, and manage your decentralized websites.
- **XSD (Lending and Borrowing Protocol)**: Explore borrowing and lending functionalities within our testnet ecosystem.

Prepare your applications thoroughly on the Geneva testnet to ensure seamless deployment and optimal performance on the Moonchain mainnet.
