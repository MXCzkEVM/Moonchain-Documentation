# Roadmap 2025

## Building the Future

As we stand on the brink of a new era, Moonchain is poised for a transformative journey that blends cutting-edge innovation with sustainable growth. 2025 is not just a comeback, but a bold resurgence, one that will see us emerge stronger, smarter, and more aligned with our vision of a decentralized future. With a renewed commitment to transparency, security, and user empowerment, we are laying the foundation for lasting success. This roadmap isn’t just a plan; it’s a blueprint for change—a clear path to reshape the world via the power of technology, crypto, and community.


## Q1 2025
### Moonchain Bridge
We launch the highly anticipated multi-token bridge, revolutionizing mining by offering fast token transfers and enabling swaps across a variety of tokens, including Ethereum-based stablecoins. The new Moonchain bridge will be a bridge to the world. 
### Doge Mining
Welcome to the world of premium multi-token mining, [DOGE](https://www.universal.xyz/) mining comes to Moonchain! Moonchain’s ecosystem partners keep the promise to NEO miners, introducing [DOGE mining](https://www.universal.xyz/), upholding transparency and delivering on legacy commitments.

### WearFi Integration: Mining Through Wearables
Moonchain integrates “[WearFi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHcFixeH9YY)” technology, allowing users to mine with everyday wearable devices like smartwatches and rings. This opens mining to a global audience, increasing utility and adoption of Moonchain tokens.



## Q2 2025
### Official IHO Launch
The mining revolution begins with Moonchain’s [Initial Hardware Offering (IHO)](https://iho.moonchain.com/), delivering the world’s first free, cutting-edge physical hardware miners to holders of Moonchain tokens via an Ethereum-based smart contract. This removes hardware costs for users, driving demand and igniting participation in a world first groundbreaking new mining model. We are giving back to the world of mining via free mining hardware, delivered to your door, for free! 

### Strategic Industry Partnership
Moonchain partners with an industry-leading data partner, leveraging anonymized data from miners and wearable devices. We integrate this data into consumer products, adopting Moonchain AI technology to optimize user experience and create a powerful revenue model. By incorporating ZK-Rollup scalability and LoRaWAN technology, we enhance Moonchain’s potential in the growing DePin ecosystem.
### IHO Expansion: New Miner “Health Based” & “Gamified” Models + Global Distribution Hubs
Moonchain introduces high-efficiency “Health Based” token Hardware to the Free IHO catalog, alongside distribution hubs in key locations for quicker deliveries. Limited-edition miners with higher hash rates will also be available to incentivize early token locking.
### Strategic Partnerships with Mining Hardware Manufacturers
We expand our partnerships with third-party [hardware manufacturers](https://iot.mi.com/vela?language=en), enhancing the IHO’s hardware catalog and broadening Moonchain’s ecosystem to include more diverse mining options for our community. Continuing to add more mineable hardware to the IHO. 
### AI Data Center Partnerships for Scaling
Collaborating with global data centers like [MCP](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol), Moonchain will scale mining operations, supporting mass adoption and ensuring reliability. With a key focus on AI-driven recommendations to maximize mining efficiency for users and enable AI data marketplaces for LLMs such as chatGPT to query and analyze.
### Enhanced Smart Contract Security
Implement advanced audits and multi-signature security measures to ensure that Moonchain’s token-locking and mining operations set the standard for safety and transparency.
### zkEVM GAS Fee Upgrade & Transaction Speed Optimization
Moonchain upgrades to zkEVM (Zero-Knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine), further decreasing GAS Fees, whilst improving interoperability and speed and enabling scalable decentralized application (dApp) development. This upgrade lowers gas fees and provides developers with the tools to build decentralized applications (DePin, AI, and DeFi) on Moonchain.


## Q3 2025
### Moonchain MoonBase App Update
The [MoonBase Mining App](https://mxc1usd.com/) will be updated, giving IHO participants the ability to more easily monitor miner performance, track earnings, deposit, swap, or bridge tokens, and manage locked tokens in real-time via MetaMask or Moonbase wallets.
### Moonchain Pay: Crypto Payment Integration
Introducing Moonchain Pay, a crypto payment gateway that allows users to use, spend, swap, or tip others with Moonchain tokens. Collaborating with third-party payment processors like [Visa and Mastercard](https://www.mastercard.com/global/en/business/issuers/crypto.html), Moonchain Pay leverages fast ZK-Rollup transactions to increase real-world token usability.
### DeFi Staking Pools on Moonchain
Moonchain launches decentralized staking pools, allowing IHO participants to stake mined Moonchain tokens for additional yield, boosting token utilities like stable coins with Moonchain and RWA as collaterals. These low-fee, high-security pools, powered by zkEVM, will rival Ethereum-based DeFi platforms, offering a seamless staking experience across decentralized wallets.

## Q4 2025
### DePin Lending
Develop DePIN-specific lending protocols using bridged assets as collateral and Enable hardware operators to borrow against future earnings using USDT/ETH
### Moonchain Global Mining Summit
Moonchain hosts a hybrid virtual and in-person summit, showcasing success stories from the IHO, unveiling AI-driven mining optimization technology, and announcing a multi-million-dollar ecosystem fund for new startup initiatives, driving further growth and adoption of Moonchain.
### Launch of Moonchain Mining Academy
We introduce the Moonchain Mining Academy, an educational platform designed to teach users how to optimize their mining operations, onboard new users, manage crypto portfolios, and stay informed about trends in the mining space. This academy is geared toward new users, partnering with respected educational institutions to convert non-crypto users to our space with a particular focus on those entering the world of Moonchain mining from a Web2 background.
### Expanded Cross-Blockchain Integration - Wormhole / Layerzero
Moonchain expands its ecosystem to support additional blockchain networks, with a planned integration for [Wormhole](https://wormhole.com/) and [Layerzero](https://layerzero.network/) including their associated tokens. This cross-chain integration allows even more users to participate in Moonchain mining and token locking, driving the growth of our community and ecosystem.

##
These Moonchain initiatives form the blueprint for our bold future—one where innovation, community, and the decentralized web converge to shape a more empowered, connected world. The journey ahead is just beginning, and we’re thrilled to have you with us every step of the way.

Sincerely, 

Moonchain Team
